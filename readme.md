## Avora is redefining how we express ourselves in voice and identity. Whether it’s Morgan Freeman, Shrek, or your favorite anime character — you choose who you are

### Imagine a chat app where you don’t just text — you become the voice of anyone you want.
With our app, users select a persona — it could be an actor, fictional character, public figure, or even a custom personality. Once set, every message they send is automatically transformed to match that persona’s tone, vocabulary, and style using AI-powered voice modulation and text transformation.

Think WhatsApp meets Snapchat Lenses, but for personality and expression — not visuals.

Whether it's texting like Tony Stark, roasting like Deadpool, or comforting like Morgan Freeman, your digital identity becomes as expressive and dynamic as you are. It's not just chat. It's roleplay, voiceplay, and self-expression — all in one


### We're building a new layer of digital identity — where how you sound matters as much as what you say. This is the future of social expression, powered by AI



### MVP features :

Social login via Supabase, User selects from a list of predefined personas (e.g., Morgan Freeman, Shrek, Tony Stark, Real-time 1:1 Send/receive text messages, When a user sends a message, it’s transformed to match the selected persona’s style (basic prompt-based AI, e.g., OpenAI API use free alternatives like huggingface or from github marketplace), Simple, clean chat interface (HTML + Tailwind v4), Persona selection screen embedded within the chat screen
Login/signup screens, FastAPI server for API endpoints (auth, persona, chat history), Socket.io for real-time messaging
Supabase can save time on auth and user management. FastAPI + Socket.io + MongoDB is a proven combo for chat apps.

GIve me a list of features for this application that can be developed for this. Note, we have to develop this application in a short amount of time and create MVP that is functional, later we can add extra features and make it even better. 


I want to develop this application. 

create two directories, one for frontend and other for the backend. 

we will develop this app together following good coding practices. We will keep it nicely done and well developed. 
following are the technologies we will use. make srue if these technologies would be right for our application. 
FASTAPI, MongoDb Socket.io, html, tailwind v4, and other things. 
we can also use Supabase to ease up things and speed up the development process.

note : we have to develop this in short amount of time. we will create fully working prototype that works and deos the intended task. I just have few hours before the submission. 

anything that is not required for the MVP we will do it later on after developing and deploying the MVP. 

give me a plan and we can then start implementing once I confim.
